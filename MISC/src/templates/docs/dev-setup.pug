      div <strong>Please note:</strong> this step is absolutely optional. It aims for advanced users who want to speed up development process with professional grade Front-End toolset shiped with Finder. If you are not familiar with these tools and have no time to dive in you can still use plain HTML / CSS / JS to customize Finder. Files you need are located inside <strong>Finder/dist</strong> folder. In this case you can skip this and next sections. Happy coding :)

    p.fw-bold.text-dark Finder is built using modern development toolset.
